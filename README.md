# ZEN - Smart Home with Voice Assistance
Nowadays, houses are going through a swift change to make them more
and more comfortable. Home automation is an example of this. Our target
is to build a project where the homeowners can control some of the
appliances of the house, like the fan and the light via their voice. There will
also be a lamp that will automatically turn on at night. Safety and security
are also emphasized in this project. As such, our project will also have a
fire alarm in case of fire. Moreover, in this project, the homeowners will
have the authentication system to prevent break-in. Finally, there will also
be a water level sensor for the water tank of the house.
